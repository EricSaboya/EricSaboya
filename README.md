## Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Bristol 

As an atmospheric scientist with a background in pure mathematics and physics, Dr. Eric Saboya has diverse experience in developing methods for quantifying sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. He is currently a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Bristol working with Prof. Matt Rigby and Anita Ganesan. Eric completed his PhD in the Department of Physics, Imperial College London with Drs. Heather Graven and Tim Arnold. 

### Research Interests
  o Regional atmospheric modellings of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O)

  o Application of Bayesian methods for source and sink attribution

  o Carbon isotopes as atmospheric tracers
